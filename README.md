# AI Coursework: Literature Review and MATLAB Implementation

Welcome to the repository for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) coursework, where we embark on a journey to explore and implement fundamental algorithms in the realm of AI. This project combines the theoretical understanding of AI concepts with practical hands-on experience through the implementation of three key algorithms: Neural Network, K Means, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Overview

This coursework is structured around two main components: a comprehensive literature review and the implementation of the specified algorithms using MATLAB. The aim is to provide a balanced approach that not only delves into the theoretical foundations of AI but also allows for practical experimentation and coding.

## Literature Review

The literature review section of this coursework will provide a deep dive into the existing research and knowledge surrounding the three chosen algorithms. It will explore the historical development, key concepts, and various applications of Neural Networks, K Means, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The review will serve as a foundation for understanding the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of these algorithms.

## MATLAB Implementation

The hands-on aspect of this coursework involves the implementation of the specified algorithms using MATLAB. MATLAB is a powerful tool that facilitates easy prototyping and experimentation in the field of AI. The MATLAB code provided in this repository will serve as a practical guide for understanding the inner workings of Neural Networks, K Means, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

### Implemented Algorithms

1. **Neural Network:** Dive into the world of artificial neural networks, exploring concepts like layers, activation functions, and backpropagation. The MATLAB code will guide you through the implementation of a simple neural network for classification tasks.

2. **K Means:** Uncover the secrets of clustering with the K Means algorithm. The MATLAB code will demonstrate how to partition data into distinct groups based on similarity, providing insights into the clustering process.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Explore the intuitive and effective KNN algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The MATLAB code will guide you through the implementation of KNN, showcasing its simplicity and versatility.
